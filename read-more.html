  <h2>Theoretical Basis</h2>
  <h3>Carl Rogers' Humanistic Theory of Personality Development
  By Dr. Saul McLeod, updated 2014
  </h3>
  <p>Humanistic psychologist Carl Rogers (1902â€“1987) agreed with Abraham Maslow's core precepts. Rogers (1959) noted that a
  person needs authenticity (openness and self-disclosure), acceptance (being viewed with unconditional positive regard),
  and empathy for them to "grow" however (being listened to and understood). <br><br>
  Similar to how a tree won't grow without sunlight and water, relationships and healthy personalities won't flourish as
  they should without them. Rogers believed that every person could achieve their goals, wishes, and desires in life.
  When, or rather if they did so, self-actualization took place. <br><br>
  The focus of humanistic psychology was on how each person shapes their internal and external environments. He held the
  belief that individuals are creative, active beings who only consider the connections, perspectives, and circumstances
  that are happening right now. In order to emphasize free choice and the possibility of kindness in people, Roger
  developed his personality development hypothesis.<br><br>
  One of Carl Rogers' most significant contributions to psychology was that in order for someone to realize their full
  potential, a number of conditions must be met.<br><br>
  Personality Development<br><br>
  The idea of oneself or one's self-concept is essential to Rogers' personality theory. The phrase "the ordered,
  consistent collection of perceptions and ideas about oneself" is used to characterize this. The humanistic phrase for
  who we truly are as individuals are the self. The self, often known as the soul or Freud's psyche, is our inner
  personality. The experiences a person has in life and how we interpret those events to have an impact on who we are. Our
  self-concept is primarily influenced by two factors: our early experiences, and other people's opinions of us.<br><br>
  We desire to feel, experience and act in ways that are compatible with our self-image and that mirror our ideal selves,
  according to Rogers (1959). The more consistent or congruent we are, and the better our feeling of self-worth, the
  closer our self-image and ideal self are to one another.
  If a portion of a person's whole experience is unsatisfactory to them and is rejected or twisted in their self-image,
  they are said to be in a condition of incongruence.<br><br>
  
  The humanistic approach states that the self is composed of concepts unique to ourselves. The self-concept includes
  three components:<br><br>
  
  
  Self-worth<br>
  (or self-esteem) comprises what we think about ourselves. Rogers believed feelings of self-worth developed in early
  childhood and were formed from the interaction of the child with the mother and father.<br><br>

  Self-image<br>
  How we see ourselves, is important to good psychological health. Self-image includes the influence of our body image on
  our inner personality. At a simple level, we might perceive ourselves as a good or bad person, beautiful or ugly.
  Self-image affects how a person thinks, feels, and behaves in the world.<br><br>
  
  Ideal-self<br>
  This is the kind of person we aspire to be. Our life objectives and aspirations make up this dynamic, always-shifting
  system. The ideal self we had as children is different from the ideal self we have as teenagers, adults, etc.
  <br><br>
  According to Carl Rogers (1951), a kid has two fundamental needs: the approval of others and a sense of value.
  The way we perceive ourselves and how we feel about our values is crucial to our psychological well-being as well as our
  chances of realizing our dreams and aspirations in life and reaching self-actualization.<br><br>
  There is a spectrum of self-worth, ranging from extremely high to extremely low. According to Carl Rogers (1959), a
  person who has high self-worth embraces obstacles in life, accepts failure and misery at times, and is honest with
  others. This person is confident and feels good about themselves. A person with poor self-worth may shy away from
  problems, refuse to acknowledge that life can occasionally be hard and miserable, and display defensiveness.<br><br>

  Congruence<br>
  The ideal self of a person could not match their experiences and actual life circumstances. Consequently, there can be a
  discrepancy between a person's ideal self and their real experience. It is known as incongruence.
  A condition of congruence arises when an individual's ideal self and real experience are congruent or strikingly
  comparable. All persons feel some degree of incongruence; complete congruence is rare if ever, experienced. The
  emergence of congruence depends on unwavering admiration. According to Carl Rogers, in order to experience
  self-actualization, a person must be in a condition of congruence.
  We want to feel, experience, and act in ways that are compatible with our self-image and that mirror our ideal selves,
  according to Rogers.
  The more consistent or congruent we are, and the better our feeling of self-worth, the closer our self-image and ideal
  self are to one another. If a portion of a person's whole experience is unsatisfactory to them and is rejected or
  twisted in their self-image, they are said to be in a condition of incongruence. A difference between the organism's
  real experience and the individual's self-picture in as much as it portrays that experience is referred to as
  incongruence.<br><br>
  The drive to self-actualize, or the desire to reach the maximum possible level of "human-beingness," was Carl Rogers'
  (1959) theory that all human beings have. People will thrive and realize their potential if their environment is
  conducive, much like a flower that will bloom to its full potential given the correct circumstances but is limited by
  its surroundings. The potential of each individual person is different from that of a flower, though, because we are
  designed to grow in different ways depending on our personalities. Rogers thought that creativity and goodness are
  innate qualities in humans.<br><br>
  They only turn toxic when a negative self-concept or outside pressures take precedence over the process of valuation.
  According to Carl Rogers, in order to experience self-actualization, a person must be in a condition of congruence. This
  indicates that when a person's "ideal self" (i.e., whom they would want to be) is consistent with their actual conduct,
  self-actualization takes place (self-image). According to Rogers, a person who is actualizing is a whole human being.
  Childhood experiences are the major factor that determines whether we will become self-actualized adults.
